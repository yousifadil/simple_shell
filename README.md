This is ALX Software Engineering 0x16.C - Simple Shell team project.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Our team is Yousuf Adil and Abuabaida Salih.

our plan is simple, yet effective

we'll make a headers file, entry point file, prompt file, user input file and finally code execution file.

-headers file contains all headers and functions used

-entry point file contains main function and while loop to keep the programm running

-prompt file contains the function of the prompt

-user input file reads user input and deals with empty lines.

-execution file deals with command execution process
